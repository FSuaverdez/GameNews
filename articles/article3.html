        <h2 class="title">Updates on Majors and Coaching</h2>

        <p>Valve is plannig to bring CS:GO Major to Rio, where one of the most passionate fanbase in gaming world is
          located. But Valve is taking precautions by delaying the event due to the current pandemic. </p>

        <span class="quote">"At the time, we couldn’t have imagined the global challenges that have limited live events
          throughout 2020. We’re not going to ask players and fans to risk their health in order to attend a Major while
          the pandemic still poses a threat to travelers. Therefore, we have made the painful decision to cancel the
          November Major.
          "</span>

        <span class="quote">"So, what’s the plan? First, we’re going to hold off on scheduling Majors until, at a
          minimum, Regional Major Ranking (RMR) LAN events are safe to hold around the world. Until then, we expect to
          continue to hold online RMR events to keep track of the best teams in each region."</span>
        <p>There are also several coaches and teams that are caught taking advantage of a bug. They are using the bug to
          gain advantage. Valve said that the teams that were disqualified for exploiting bugs will have their RMR
          points reset.</p>

        <span class="quote">
          Any teams that were disqualified for exploiting this bug during an RMR event will have their RMR points reset.
        </span>

        <span class="quote">
          As for taking action against individual coaches, we’re going to wait until we get a complete picture of the
          extent of the bug abuse and the punishments handed down by third parties. Regardless of those penalties,
          mid-match coaching will always be a tempting opportunity for some teams to violate the integrity of the match.
          So we may also consider limitations to coaching.
